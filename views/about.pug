            | My name is Kate and I didn't write the following text: I have been developing websites and applications for around 5 years. Most my experience lies in full stack development and linux server administration. I have worked with HTML/CSS, Javascript/NodeJS, PHP, some scripting languages like rust and a little bit of C# and Python.

            | While I am not actively searching for a position, I heard that there are some devops positions that are available and that happens to be the same direction that I want to take in my career. I also grew up playing pokemon stadium/red blue and yellow on my gameboy and nintendo 64!

            | You will find high level summaries of my job duties/education history in my resume. If you want to see some of the projects that I work on in my spare time, see my GitHub profile: github.com/conneraiken and my portfolio site: fittedtech.com (recommendations, some portfolio items and more).

            |  If you check out my github, it is mostly boilerplate projects that are not finalized. I do not feel that they are accurate representations of the quality of work that I bring as a full time employee but it will give you a sense of the technologies that I work with frequently. Most of my work has not been open sourced unfortunately. However, I am more than happy to create a sample web application project to showcase my full stack/dev ops skills.
